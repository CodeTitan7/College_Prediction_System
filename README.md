# College_Prediction_System


The "College Prediction System" offers a unique facility for predicting the chances of getting admission to various colleges in Kerala by applicants using their KEAM exam and Category. For the same, it requires some relevant details from users which are Application Number, Marks Obtained in KEAM, Category (General/ OBC /SC) etc, Marks obtained in the PCM (Physics Chemistry and Mathematics) subjects.

The system predicts the college based on the previous year cutoff laid by the college, that the student may have a chance of getting into, using them the next academic year.

It has My-SQL as the core database where user inputs and takes cutoff data of various colleges from Kerala from the previous year as the reference. The KEAM marks of the user are compared to cutoff trends in various colleges using statistical methods and algorithms with this data. By comparing the data, it's possible for the system to give users a list of schools where they will probably be admitted vs. maybe get in or don't think about going there!

The user interface of the "College Prediction System" is developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript ensuring a user-friendly and visually appealing experience. Python is used for server-side programming to handle form submissions, interact with the database, and perform the prediction logic. 

The primary objective of the system is to streamline the college application process, offering students a data-driven tool to make informed decisions about their higher education choices. By providing predictive insights, the system aims to reduce the uncertainty and anxiety associated with the college admissions process.
